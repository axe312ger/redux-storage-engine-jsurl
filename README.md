With this engine, you allow your users to share their application state via the URL.

It stores your passed state in the `window.location.hash` property using `window.pushState()`. With [jsurl](https://github.com/Sage/jsurl) the stored state after the fragment identifier is kind of human readable.

## Install

```js
npm install --save redux-storage-engine-jsurl
```

## Usage

Just use it as any other redux-storage engine. If your environment does not support the import syntax, see further below.

```js
import createEngine from 'redux-storage-engine-jsurl'

// In case your loader does not support the package.json module entry:
import createEngine from 'redux-storage-engine-jsurl/dist/es-modules'

const engine = createEngine()
```

### Node 6
```js
const createEngine = require('redux-storage-engine-jsurl')
const engine = createEngine()
```

### Node 4
A version for the LTS version of node is also supplied. You can require it like this:

```js
const createEngine = require('redux-storage-engine-jsurl/dist/node4')
const engine = createEngine()
```

## Options

There are no options to set. I recommend to combine the engine with [redux-storage-decorator-filter](https://github.com/react-stack/redux-storage-decorator-filter) and [redux-storage-decorator-debounce](https://github.com/react-stack/redux-storage-decorator-debounce)
to store only parts of your state in the url and avoid spamming `window.pushState()`.

## Development

This project follows the [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) coding and the [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md) commit message style. Also it is configured to never decrease the code coverage of its tests.

Also make sure you check out all available npm scripts via `npm run`.
